//initial-robot : Number Number Real Real-> Robot
//GIVEN: a set of (x,y) coordinates
RETURNS: a robot with its center at those coordinates, facing north
(up).

robot-left : Robot -> Robot
robot-right : Robot -> Robot
GIVEN: a robot
RETURNS: a robot like the original, but turned 90 degrees either left
or right.

robot-forward : Robot PosInt -> Robot
GIVEN: a robot and a distance
RETURNS: a robot like the given one, but moved forward by the
specified number of pixels distance.  If moving forward the specified number of
pixels distance would cause the robot to move from being
entirely inside the canvas room to being even partially outside the canvas room,
then the robot should stop at the wall.

robot-north? : Robot -> Boolean
robot-south? : Robot -> Boolean
robot-east? : Robot -> Boolean
robot-west? : Robot -> Boolean
GIVEN: a robot
ANSWERS: whether the robot is facing in the specified direction.
